<p>My name is Angely Suarez DeJesus and I am currently pursuing a PhD in the Text & Technology doctoral program at  the University of Central Florida. 
My interests are within the areas of rhetoric and composition. It entails the exploration of the ways in which AI algorithms managed by content moderators in large language models affect Latino women and other BIPOC groups  through textual rhetoric.

Other areas of interest are in the field of technical professional communication, digital media, and digital humanities.</p>

<p>About 8 years ago I joined a group of friends to road bike 200 miles from Providence, MA to Provincetown, MA and all along the beautiful coast of Cape Cod! This is done to raise funds and awareness of lung cancer. The association taught us that when we are riding up a hill and our breathing becomes more shallow, that is the normal breathing day of a lung cancer patient! 
  
In 2024, we lost our team captain, Bob! He taught many things about riding, performance, and endurance! His leadership and contageous personality will always live in our hearts! Rest in peace Bob, our fierce leader! PLEASE NOTE: I am NOT promoting donations to the association through my portfolio!!</p>
